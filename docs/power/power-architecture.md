# Power Architecture

Support the following requirements:

1. 6.0 - 14.0 V primary power bus (CubeSat compatability)
2. Optional 20.0 - 40.0 V primary power bus, possibly with pre-convertor (SmallSat compatability)
3. Optional secondary power bus
4. LCL (Latching Current Limiters) on all derived buses for SEU protection
5. Main bus overvoltage protection
6. Main bus undervoltage disable
7. Current and voltage telemetry of all buses
8. Optional switchable buses
